MIREX09 database : 374 Karaoke recordings of Chinese songs. Each recording is mixed at three different levels of Signal-to-Accompaniment Ratio {-5dB, 0dB, +5 dB} for a total of 1122 audio clips. Instruments: singing voice (male, female), synthetic accompaniment. The groundtruth pitch of each clip is human labeled, with a frame size of 40ms, a hop size of 20 ms. Note that the center of the first frame is located at 20ms starting from the very beginning of a clip. The human labeled pitch is then interpolated to have a hop size of 10ms. Thus the time sequence of the pitch vector are 20ms, 30ms, 40ms, 50ms, and so on.
